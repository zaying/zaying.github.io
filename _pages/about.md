## Biography
I am currently a Ph.D. student in the (Department of Electrical and Information Technology)[https://www.eit.lth.se/], (LTH)[https://www.lth.se/english/], at (Lund University)[https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/] in Sweden, supervised by (Asst. Prof. Amir Aminifar)[https://www.eit.lth.se/staff/amir.aminifar]. Before that, I received my Master's degree with Distinction in Cyber Security from [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) in 2021 and did my Master's thesis advised by Dr. [Tasmina Islam](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/tasmina-islam). I received my B.S. in Network Engineering from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2020. 

I was an EVPN protocol developer and tester at [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/en/) from 2021 to 2023.

**My research mainly focuses on security and privacy in AI/ML**.  I hope to combine my interests by using innovative Federated Learning algorithms as frameworks and rules, aided by security protocols, to systematically protect individuals' privacy on Internet of Things systems. In addition, I will also concentrate on the security of Machine Learning itself as well, to ensure that trained models behave as expected in the face of various types of attacks.
