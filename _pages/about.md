## Biography
I am currently applying for PhD positions. Before that, I received my Master's degree with Distinction in Cyber Security from [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) in 2021, and did my [Master's thesis](https://zaying.github.io/files/master_thesis.pdf) advised by Dr. [Tasmina Islam](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/tasmina-islam). I received my B.S. degree in Network Engineering from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2020. Here are my [diplomas and grades](https://zaying.github.io/files/diplomas&grades.pdf).

I was an EVPN protocol developer and tester at [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/en/) from 2021 to 2023.

**My research mainly focuses on AI security and privacy**. I hope to combine my interests by using innovative security protocols as frameworks and rules, aided by machine learning, to systematically protect individuals' privacy within data analysis, Federated Learning(FL), etc. In addition, I will concentrate on the security of machine learning itself as well, in order to ensure that trained models behave as expected in the face of various types of attacks. See more details [here](https://zaying.github.io/files/research_statement.pdf). And I am now working on a [research proposal](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xbgntykhgchn) about building a Supervisor Vetting System for FL.
